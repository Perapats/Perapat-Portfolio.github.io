            <h2>Scientists who built ‘foundation’ for AI awarded Nobel Prize</h2>
            <p class="date">Oct 8, 2024, 9:19 PM</p>
            <img src="pics/a2.jpg" alt="Blog Post Image" class="blog-image">
            <p>Two scientists credited with laying the “foundation of today’s powerful machine learning,” University of Toronto professor emeritus Geoffrey Hinton and Princeton University professor John Hopfield, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics today.</p>
            <h3><br></h3>
            <p>Their discoveries and inventions laid the groundwork for many of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Since the 1980s, their work has enabled the creation of artificial neural networks, computer architecture loosely modeled after the structure of the brain.</p>

            <h2>TikTok sued by 14 attorneys general over alleged harm to children’s mental health</h2>
            <p class="date">October 8, 2024 2:29 PM</p>
            <img src="pics/a3.jpg" alt="Blog Post Image" class="blog-image">
            <p>A bipartisan group of 14 attorneys general from across the country filed lawsuits on Tuesday against TikTok, alleging that the platform has “addicted” young people and harmed their mental health</p>
            <h3><br></h3>
            <p>The lawsuits take issue with various elements of the TikTok platform, including its endlessly scrolling feed of content, TikTok “challenge” videos that sometimes encourage users to engage in risky behavior and late-night push notifications that the attorneys general claim can disrupt kids’ sleep.</p>

            <h2>Stealthy Malware Has Infected Thousands of Linux Systems for Years</h2>
            <p class="date">Oct 5, 2024 9:30 AM</p>
            <img src="pics/ar1.jpg" alt="Blog Post Image" class="blog-image">
            <p>Thousands of machines running Linux have been infected by a malware strain that’s notable for its stealth, the number of misconfigurations it can exploit, and the breadth of malicious activities it can perform, researchers reported Thursday.</p>
            <h3><br></h3>
            <p>The malware has been circulating since at least 2021. It gets installed by exploiting more than 20,000 common misconfigurations, a capability that may make millions of machines connected to the internet potential targets, researchers from Aqua Security said. It can also exploit CVE-2023-33426, a vulnerability with a severity rating of 10 out of 10 that was patched last year in Apache RocketMQ, a messaging and streaming platform that’s found on many Linux machines.</p>
